    <div class="cs-section-label">01 — Why This Analysis</div>
    <h2>Understanding the market you're entering</h2>
    <p>Graduating into a data and technology job market being reshaped by AI is a genuinely complex situation. Some data roles are being automated. Others are expanding rapidly. New roles are emerging that didn't exist three years ago. And the skills that employers value most are shifting faster than most curriculum can keep up with.</p>
    <p>Rather than relying on anecdote and advice, I conducted a systematic analysis of the AI transformation happening across data and technology fields — treating my own career positioning as an analytical problem that deserved the same rigor as any business question.</p>
    <div class="highlight-block">
      <p>"The analysts who will thrive in an AI-augmented workplace aren't the ones who can do what AI can do. They're the ones who can do what AI can't — ask the right questions, communicate to humans, and make judgment calls."</p>

    <h2>Treating career strategy like a market analysis</h2>
    <ul class="steps-list">
      <li>
        <span class="step-n">01</span>
        <div><strong>Job Market Data Collection</strong> Analyzed job posting trends across LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor for data analyst, business analyst, and data scientist roles over a 12-month window. Tracked mention frequency of specific tools and skills to identify what employers are actually asking for vs. what's discussed in the media.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="step-n">02</span>
        <div><strong>Role Evolution Mapping</strong> Identified which traditional data roles are seeing reduced demand (pure reporting roles) vs. expanding demand (analytics engineering, data storytelling, AI-augmented analysis). Mapped the skill adjacencies between where the market is and where it's heading.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="step-n">03</span>
        <div><strong>Skills Gap Analysis</strong> Cross-referenced emerging employer requirements against my current skill set to identify the highest-priority gaps to close before graduation. Prioritized by: (1) frequency of mention in job postings, (2) expected trajectory, (3) feasibility of acquisition in the remaining time.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="step-n">04</span>
        <div><strong>Industry Report Synthesis</strong> Reviewed key industry reports from McKinsey, World Economic Forum, and LinkedIn's Workforce Reports on AI and automation to contextualize job market signals within broader structural trends.</div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="cs-section">

    <h2>What the analysis revealed about the market</h2>
    <div class="findings-grid">
      <div class="finding-card">
        <span class="finding-num">↑ SQL</span>
        <h4>SQL Demand Accelerating</h4>
        <p>SQL appears in over 75% of data analyst job postings — and its mention frequency has grown, not declined, as AI tools have proliferated. Data fluency remains foundational.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="finding-card">
        <span class="finding-num">New</span>
        <h4>Emerging: AI-Augmented Analyst</h4>
        <p>A growing category of roles explicitly combines data analysis skills with prompt engineering and AI tool proficiency — analysts who can use AI to do more, faster.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="finding-card">
        <span class="finding-num">↓ Pure</span>
        <h4>Reporting Roles Declining</h4>
        <p>Job postings for pure reporting and dashboard maintenance roles have declined as automated BI tools (Tableau, Power BI with AI features) absorb routine reporting tasks.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="finding-card">
        <span class="finding-num">↑ Story</span>
        <h4>Data Storytelling Premium</h4>
        <p>Roles emphasizing "communicating insights to non-technical stakeholders" are growing in both frequency and salary premium — communication skills are increasingly the differentiator.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>The most important structural finding: <strong>AI is not replacing data analysts — it's replacing the parts of data analysis that weren't that valuable to begin with.</strong> The high-value work — problem framing, stakeholder communication, judgment under uncertainty — is expanding in importance as the mechanical work gets automated.</p>
  </div>

    <div class="cs-section-label">04 — Strategic Implications</div>
    <h2>How this shapes my positioning</h2>
    <ul class="steps-list">
      <li>
        <span class="step-n">↳</span>
        <div><strong>Double down on communication and storytelling</strong> Technical skills are table stakes. The ability to translate complex analysis into clear business recommendations — in a deck, in a meeting, in a one-pager — is the differentiator the market is pricing. This portfolio is itself an exercise in that skill.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="step-n">↳</span>
        <div><strong>Position as AI-fluent, not AI-threatened</strong> Employers are increasingly looking for analysts who can leverage AI tools to multiply their output. Demonstrating comfort with AI-augmented workflows is a competitive advantage, not a threat to acknowledge.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="step-n">↳</span>
        <div><strong>Prioritize SQL as the next skill to deepen</strong> The job market data is unambiguous: SQL is the most universally required technical skill and its demand is growing. Moving from "basics" to proficiency is the highest-ROI technical investment for the next six months.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="step-n">↳</span>
        <div><strong>Target roles at the intersection of analysis and decision-making</strong> Business analyst, marketing analyst, and operations analyst roles all require the combination of technical data skills and business judgment that AI is least positioned to replicate. These are structurally strong career starting points.</div>
