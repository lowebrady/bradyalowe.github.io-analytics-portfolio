    <h2>Sports interest is predictable — if you look at the data</h2>
    <p>For sports media companies, sponsors, and event organizers, one of the most valuable things to know is <strong>when public interest in a sport peaks</strong> — and how far in advance that interest starts building. Get the timing wrong on a campaign and you're spending money either before anyone cares or after they've moved on.</p>
    <p>Google Trends provides a free, continuous signal of public search interest over time. The challenge is knowing how to extract meaningful patterns from the noise — particularly for sports that only have moment-in-time Olympic spikes every four years.</p>
    <div class="highlight-block">
      <p>"Google Trends data is free and publicly available. The competitive advantage isn't having the data — it's knowing how to read it well enough to make decisions others won't."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="cs-section">
    <div class="cs-section-label">02 — Methodology</div>
    <h2>Extracting signal from cyclical data</h2>
    <ul class="steps-list">
      <li>
        <span class="step-n">01</span>
        <div><strong>Data Collection via Google Trends</strong> Pulled 5-year search interest data for all nine sports: Alpine Skiing, Biathlon, Bobsled, Cross-Country Skiing, Curling, Figure Skating, Ice Hockey, Ski Jumping, and Speed Skating. Exported as CSV and imported into Excel for analysis.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="step-n">02</span>
        <div><strong>Baseline vs. Peak Calculation</strong> Calculated each sport's baseline interest (average interest score during non-Olympic, non-World Championship months) and compared it to peak interest during event windows. This generated a "spike multiplier" showing how dramatically each sport's audience expands during events.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="step-n">03</span>
        <div><strong>Lead-Time Analysis</strong> For each sport, measured how many weeks before an Olympic event search interest started to meaningfully rise above baseline — establishing an "interest runway" for each sport that informs campaign launch timing.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="step-n">04</span>
        <div><strong>Sport-to-Sport Comparison</strong> Built a comparative chart overlaying interest curves for all nine sports across the same time window, making cross-sport comparisons visible at a glance rather than requiring back-and-forth between individual charts.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="step-n">05</span>
        <div><strong>Seasonal Pattern Identification</strong> Separated Olympic years from non-Olympic years to identify which sports maintain consistent seasonal interest regardless of the games vs. which are almost entirely event-dependent.</div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="cs-section">
    <div class="cs-section-label">03 — Key Findings</div>
    <h2>Not all winter sports behave the same way</h2>
    <div class="findings-grid">
      <div class="finding-card">
        <span class="finding-num">9</span>
        <h4>Sports Analyzed</h4>
        <p>Across 5 years of Google Trends data — covering two Winter Olympics cycles for comprehensive pattern identification.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="finding-card">
        <span class="finding-num">18×</span>
        <h4>Peak Spike — Curling</h4>
        <p>Curling showed the highest spike multiplier of any sport — nearly zero baseline interest exploding to massive search volume during Olympics, making it the purest event-dependent sport in the dataset.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="finding-card">
        <span class="finding-num">6 weeks</span>
        <h4>Average Interest Runway</h4>
        <p>Across sports, search interest began rising meaningfully about 6 weeks before the Olympic opening ceremony — suggesting campaigns should launch no later than week 7 before the games.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="finding-card">
        <span class="finding-num">Year-Round</span>
        <h4>Ice Hockey & Figure Skating</h4>
        <p>These two sports maintained significant baseline interest in non-Olympic years — driven by NHL seasons and skating competition circuits — making them viable for year-round content strategy.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>A key strategic finding: <strong>most winter sports are event-dependent, not calendar-dependent</strong>. This means campaigns tied to the calendar (e.g., "winter sports season") will underperform compared to campaigns timed to the event cycle — even in non-Olympic years, World Championships and World Cups drive measurable interest spikes.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="cs-section">
    <div class="cs-section-label">04 — Strategic Recommendations</div>
    <h2>Timing is the campaign variable that matters most</h2>
    <ul class="steps-list">
      <li>
        <span class="step-n">↳</span>
        <div><strong>For Olympic years: launch campaigns 6–7 weeks pre-opening ceremony</strong> This is when audience interest starts building. Early-launch campaigns can ride the organic interest curve rather than fighting for attention at peak when everyone else is spending.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="step-n">↳</span>
        <div><strong>For non-Olympic years: anchor content to World Championships and World Cups</strong> These events generate measurable (if smaller) interest spikes for most sports. A calendar of these events provides a year-round content framework that doesn't require waiting for the Olympics.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="step-n">↳</span>
        <div><strong>Treat Ice Hockey and Figure Skating as evergreen — all others as event-driven</strong> Only these two sports justify significant off-cycle content investment. For the other seven, concentrate budget around event windows and don't waste spend in the flat baseline periods.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="step-n">↳</span>
        <div><strong>Use Curling's spike as a cultural moment opportunity</strong> Curling's extreme event-dependence means it captures enormous mainstream attention for a short window. Brands with no normal connection to curling can legitimately ride this spike with timely, playful content.</div>
